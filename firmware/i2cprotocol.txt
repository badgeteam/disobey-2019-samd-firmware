i2c protocol
commands (write):
0x01: set LED (ledid, r,g,b)
    r,g,b=0-0xff
    ledid=0-5, 6=all
0x02: set backlight (value=0-255)
0x03: set buzzer freq (freq (2 bytes, Hz, 0=off), duration (2 bytes, ms, 0=continuous))
0x04: set everything off (backlight, LEDs, buzzer)

state (read):
byte 0: button state 0|U|T0|T1|T2|T3|T4|T5 (U is USB connected status)
byte 1: battery state
reading state resets interrupt



Touch state machine:

IDLE = 0
WAITING
DONE

(internal state: readings, buttonstate, offsets, curindex)

Transitions:
IDLE (check number of iterations) -> DONE, index=-1
DONE (increment index, start conversion) -> (if index<6)->WAITING (if index==6)->IDLE
WAITING (check conversion state) -> (id conversion ready)->DONE (else)->WAITING

LED driver setup:

(internal state: value of each LED for each channel, led index, channel index)

On timer trigger: 
    disable all LEDs, 
    increment channel index, 
    if channel index==3 reset channel index to zero, increment LED index
    if led index==6 reset led index to 0
Enable anode of LED pointed to by LED index (set to high)
Set cathode PWM duty cycle to 255-value[channel]
